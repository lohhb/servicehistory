<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">NS-7080W(S/N: 121040, NS7KW-06) that is installed with Automat in this August by EPSON sub-con) during dummy device run with FT256 17x17 Quad, Binning only with Auto1 encountered Error 3 Subsidiary 13, error message is Tray lock cylinder (backward) error for Tray Unloader 3 Sensor , which is either(SQ157) doesn't turn ON or The tray lock doesn't move backward. I did a printscreen of the error but forgot to copy to my thumbdrive.After add Binning to include Auto2, then no error. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">How come this error comes up when now there is no Auto3 but Automat?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Kindly check with EPSON why?Wasted time trying to troubleshoot, looking for this cylinder &amp; I/O module. This morning, after installed FT256 17x17 Quad site C/K, during Homing, Empty tray arm, Index Arm homed, but Input Arm move to inbetween Input Shuttle 1 &amp; 2 stopped. Found Input Hand Rotator&rsquo;s dog plate hit onto hardstopper, so cannot complete homing.In SPEL, try to MCAL rb7 &amp; rb8 but but dog plate hit to hardstoper.Also restart handler but same error. Change to different setup files also same problem.Had to remove the stopper plate on Input rotator and MCAL, ok. Changed HOFS from -250 to 1370 and put back stopper plate.Restart handler &amp; HOME, ok. However, the Input Hand rotator dog plate was totally out away from the sensor. In SPEL CT changed the rotator HOFS back to -250. Able to HOME. Dry run handler ok.&nbsp; Back track to last week after setup &amp; power up this handler, when HOME handler, encountered RC520 error for Empty tray Arm torque error, Input shuttle torque error, Index Arm torque error &amp; etc. Restart a few times also same problem. Came back after lunch and don&rsquo;t know why no more torque error. However, when trying to dry run without C/K, Automat error for slot plate protruding out of Automat occurred, had to adjust the sensor SQ212. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">There is also an Automat error which I forgot what it was, need to check the MMI error.</span></p>
