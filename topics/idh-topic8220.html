<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Handler Model: NS-7080W</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Controller: RC520</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Date: 9~10 Feb 2009</span></p>
<p class="ps133"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps133"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Xilinx complained that device drop again on index arm 2 sites B, D, F and H using the new Socket Layout Kit (S/LK) that was passed to them via Goto san. SLK NS7KW-LK13 (used to work on this issue last week) was fitted to verify problem and everything was good, just need to do fine-tuning (that is, no device drop when using LK13). </span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps133"><span class="ts23">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps163"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;Fine tuning was carried out as there were a lot of floating errors and misplacement at unloader. There was also another error on hand up sensor (input and output arms), whereby after much troubleshooting, it was found out that the individual hand grounding cable was the root cause, thus adjusted and no more error thereafter.</span></p>
<p class="ps164"><span class="ts1">&nbsp; After solving the above problem, the new SLK was put back and the error still persist.&nbsp; It was noticed that there was a gap between the compliance unit and SLK, thus, KA lift up both brackets (using 0.5mm washers temporarily) that held the latch and dummy run at 100% without problem.&nbsp; KA will make shims to replace the temporary washers.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Tray measurement was carried out for unloader limit sensor project (limit is 12 trays as requested by Xilinx).</span></p>
