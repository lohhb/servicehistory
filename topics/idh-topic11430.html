<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if they accept some of the risk and adjustment of sensor, it can be used.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This is based on just verification. (This is not evaluation in EPSON factory)</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">7)&nbsp; EPSON NS8000 cover the counter air adjustment. This is to prevent end user adjust because experience tells us once change, every conversion will adjust.

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">Your question 8)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">This is based on our experience.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">We have ever run 3x3 packages.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">However, it is difficult to judge only device size.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">There are a lot of factors. (Device material, surface condition, Change kit etc…)</span></p>

<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Remarks</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Email 27 Dec 2009 on UTAC NS-8080-1 (8 Hands High UPH)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Let me refresh/summerize what's been happening so far for this handler.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">13/Dec -&gt; 24/Dec 2070P 4x4.5x0.8 package</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Flying device for multiple sites happening on output shuttle 2.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) Final settings achieved and monitoring for 6 days.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Pick and Release height difference 1mm</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Counter Air On 0.1s</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Turn off and rise 0.1s</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Speed/Accel 100%</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Results improved till just 1 condition error for 24/Dec</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2070P conversion to 2070C 4x4.5x0.6 package</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Same input shuttle</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) Same output shuttle</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Same Socket Layout Kit and Contactor head.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">4) ONLY different nest used</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">5) All contactor head -80+Kpa strong pickup from shuttle on both index arm. NOTE that 2070P, low vacuum reading from -40+kPa -&gt; -80+kPa.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-This is already a question mark on design. Why just a nest difference will have strong vacuum pickup.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">6) Double device not able to detect (This comes back to the question of change kit control? or our design concept supposed to always power tune/manual adjust sensitivity for conversion)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">24/Dec -&gt; 27/Dec 2070C</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1)&nbsp; Same settings of 1mm difference used.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2)&nbsp; Site1, Site2 and Site7 consistant jam. Situation worst than 2070P running.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3)&nbsp; Evetually Site7 disabled and Site1 intermittent jam. Line technician changed 1mm-&gt;0.8mm with counter air on 0.3s.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">4)&nbsp; GETECH support 26/Dec, 1.30pm-&gt;3.00am.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">5)&nbsp; Enabled site7 and saw site7 has device missing. Site1 has device stuck on contactor head.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">6)&nbsp; Pick and Released changed back to 2mm and counter air on 0.1s.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">7)&nbsp; Site1 no problem but site7 has device floating on pocket.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">8)&nbsp; Tried height from 1mm-&gt;2mm. Tried counter air on from 0.1s-&gt;0.3s and Turn off and rise delay from 0.1s-&gt;0.3s. All 3 settings combined for monitoring BUT unable to achive smooth running.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">9)&nbsp; Best setting is height about 1.3mm-&gt;1.7mm with counter air on and turn off and rise delay 0.2s able to run 1/5000 units.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">10)However, site7 continue to jam so current settings now 1.5mm/0.2s/0.2s</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Fact Findings from KA and UTAC line engineers</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1)&nbsp; NS7160W was used to run 2070P and was able to run.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2)&nbsp; NS7160W was used to run 2070C and was unable to run smoothly like current NS8080 situation.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3)&nbsp; According to KA (you can refer to my mail below sent to UTAC), </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Buy off for 2070C was very very difficult (NS7000 was used. probably NS7080)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Counter air flow was adjusted and adjusted untill able to run</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Counter air on timing was try and error many times</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Speed/Accel is NOT 100%</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-After doing all of above, manage to clear jam rate buyoff for kit in 2000 units running. I repeat...2000 units running. I do not know exactly what jam rate but it should at least be same as handler.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Handler can be fine tune to run if kit design is not so good like adjust sensitivity and flow and timing etc...But is this correct or should change kit be controlled for different size/thickness device?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-2070C on the shuttle already cannot detect double device...I do not know who's decide to use same shuttle for different thickness but it seems, KA allowed because they made the nest.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">My Question??</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1)&nbsp; Can same shuttle run for 2 different device thickness? Please note that this shuttle has modification change. PLEASE check with KA what has been changed. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2)&nbsp; If just nest change is able to run, why need to adjust counter air when KA buy off kit?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3)&nbsp; Does EPSON design concept allow same shuttle to run 2 different device thickness?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">4)&nbsp; KA buy off kit 2000 units. Is this specifications suitable to justify kit is buyoff successful?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">5)&nbsp; KA adjusted flow rate to low, speed/accel to low to buyoff kit, should the same settings be used for production?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">6)&nbsp; Why are we using 100% and fastest condition to do jam rate of 5000x3 for HOT mode if KA buy off kit is just 2000units and low settings?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">7)&nbsp; EPSON NS8000 cover the counter air adjustment. This is to prevent end user adjust because experience tells us once change, every conversion will adjust. Or design concept is totally CANNOT adjust? If it is allowed to adjust but only by GETECH, please give us the spec sheet flow rate, speed/accel, counter air on and turn off and rise timing recommendation for all size/thickness.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">8)&nbsp; Can I check, the recommendation, is based on actual running by EPSON facts OR just based on theory and concept and experience?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">This is not to point or not to complain but I think it is time for us to align how EPSON/KA/GETECH should work. It seems how kit is buyoff does not correlate to what customers expect from handler and EPSON design rule, actually is just what height for example like the hardstop and plunger height etc.....but change kit design, still very much from KA. We understand it is impossible to send every design from KA to EPSON for verification but this is exactly the reason why whenever EPSON engineer is in singapore and sees the change kit at customer place, they always say should be this and should not be that etc...</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">GETECH can support sat/sun and work till 3am in the morning but if EPSON/KA/GETECH work is not align, GETECH will only be having hell time because we are front line to customers. Like now this NS8080 running on 2 different packages and already, I have so many questions above. When I have questions, it means that EPSON/KA/GETECH work is not align and not same understanding.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Please consider my email seriously because I think it is time for us to align how EPSON/KG/KA/GETECH can work in the same understanding and direction. For a long time, we've always been working in our own direction like KA buy off change kit with not 100% settings but customer expect handler to run 100% with all package/change kit.. Already this have different buyoff for different expectations, how can GETECH make handler run 100% condition when change kit buyoff already cannot?</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Hi Laurence,</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Initial setup 2070P (4 x 4.5 x 0.8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Current setup 2070C (4 x 4.5 x 0.6)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Same shuttle except nest different.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">After 2070P was converted to 2070C, NS8080-01 had the same problem like 2070P initial setup as well as 10w was running for 2070C</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">26/Dec 1.30pm-&gt;6.00pm</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-----------------------------------</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Conversion crew ran 1 full tray 24/Dec and no jam. Pick and Release height difference as 2070P of 1mm.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) Jam occured for multiple sites but only for Output shuttle 2. Eventually, site7 was disabled as it happened frequently. Site1 and site2 had occasional jam. Final settings were Pick and Release Height difference of 0.8mm and counter air on time 0.3s. 24/Dec-&gt;26/Dec before trigger vendor. Contactor head swap but still site7. All jams occured for only shuttle 2.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Vendor support-Enabled site7 and jams occured on site1 and site7. Shuttle height calibration carried out again and eventually used Pick and Release height of 1.7mm with counter air @ 0.1s.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">4) Running for 2 hours no jam for site1 and site7.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">5) 1.5 hours after 6.00pm, jams started for site7 output shuttle.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;26/Dec 9.00pm-&gt;27/Dec 3.00am</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-----------------------------------</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Jams are now only for site7 with site1 so far running fine after 1.7mm.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) We're now seeing the same symptoms where it can run smoothly for 1-2 hours before the jam starts.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Only difference was 2070P, site1 having the jam but 2070C has site7 having jam. Nest cleaning can improve the jam but it comes back after awhile.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">4) Final settings @ 2.2mm height, 0.2 counter air and 0.2 delay for counter air turn off and rise for index arm.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">5) Monitor till 3am and ok.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Please allow us to check on:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Same shuttle for same package but just 0.2mm thickness difference.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) The nest was buyoff by Knight Auto and fact findings as follows:-</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- KA had a hard time to buyoff (2070C) in 2000 units running</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- Adjustment done to counter air flowrate as well as timing (hard time getting the suitable flow for 2000 units running)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- Speed/Aceel was set to slower than 100% in order to pass 2000 units running</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- 10w ran fine with 2070P but 2070C unable to run smoothly (feedback from line)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- These are feedback from KA during buyoff of nest for 2070C in just 2000 units running.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Design concept is such that we should not be adjusting the counter air flow because running on another package will have problems again so kindly allow us to feedback with Japan on 2070P and 2070C conditions. We'll get back to you a.s.a.p on our concerns. Monday, when the air flow meter arrives, we'll also measure individual counter air flow to confirm our concerns on the air purge flow rate.</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Design concept for 4x4.2x0.58 (during buyoff) and 4x4.5x0.6/0.8 (I2070C/I2070P) contact plunger.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-We encountered 0 device stuck/jam for index when we buyoff using 4x4.2x0.58 (this package is smaller and more thin than I2070C/I2070P)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-We encountered jams/device stuck for both I2070C/I2070P on both arms and only after much tune of Pick/Release Height for index on shuttle, counter air on timing and turn off and release delay, minimize jams.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Just a possibility that the air purge cause some suction if instead of exhasut through the shuttle corners, it goes into the gap between metal plunger and plunger guide for I2070C/P.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-0.1s to 0.3s counter air on, device stuck but will drop after a while or chamber door open. 0.4s to 0.5s counter air on, device stuck but will not drop. Need to use finger to touch then deivce will drop. It seems the longer/stronger the counter air on, the suction seems stronger thus enforcing me to suspect the air purge is maybe entering the gap causing unforeseen suction. Just a possibility.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) Flowrate we measure was 2.4-&gt;2.8l/min and in line with EPSON recommendation, however like I mention, while flowrate is OK, but plunger diameter affects pressure thus effect of air purge, I'm not sure if this will affect to device release.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Perhaps we can check diameter difference for 4x4.2x0.58 and the I2070 plungers also. Cause using visual, it seems 4x4.2 metal plunger diameter is bigger than 4x4.5 metal plunger. So a small diamter hole may have a bigger air pressure even though flow rate is same. Please see if you can verify this with EPSON.</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">KA meeting summary</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) According to Mike, design concept is supposed to restrict device place not more than 2.5mm.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-This means in theory, input shuttle should be 5mm hardstop and output shuttle should be 7.5mm. This is the only way to prevent lower than 2.5 release height and this is assuming during pick up, when contact blade touch hardstop, device pick up is just nice on pocket.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) KA mentioned metal plunger guide concept is requested by Jaya so we'll have a set of new contactor without metal plunger guide by next week.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-However in this case, please check with Mike if this is ok for both I2070C/P or ONLY for I2070C.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Because UTAC said both package, ONLY nest change but if there's no plunger guide, I'm not sure if the new metal plunger height can be used for both I2070C/P.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Fact findings from change kit</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Hardstop for BOTH input shuttle and output shuttle is 6.5mm.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) According to Jaya, this shuttle pocket depth is modified to be DEEPER + exhaust hole for air purge at 4 corners are made BIGGER and this concept is supposedly to improve running condition.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-As usual, actual change kit when modified, is always NOT updated to Mike and drawing that is why Mike mentioned in meeting, drawing is 2.5mm control.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Taking in consideration the 4 hardstops are @ 6.5mm now, the pockets are deeper and exhaust for air purge made bigger, this actually affects the whole design concept of pick and place.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Meaning when KA make the new contactors, they must take into consideration now when contact blade touch 6.5mm hardstop during pickup, how much device is above shuttle pocket because now pocket is made deeper. He needs to know this so that the length of metal plunger must be made correct for I2070C and I2070P.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Better for us to know what is the actual device height from pocket when pick up so that we will know how much release height we can use.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">example: Actual device height from pcket during release = Deivce height from pcket during pick up based on 6.5mm + Pick/Release height difference for device release</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) NEW FINDING yesterday was is it possible for some static/charge on device surface that cause this device stuck to contactor height.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-4x4.2x0.58 contactor plunger, is grounded. Measure resistivity and about 1 ohms.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-4x4.5x0.60 contactor plunger, is NOT grounded. Measure resistivity and found OPEN or even when push plunger/compliance compressed, is 2-3 Mega Ohms.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-This gives me another concern of possible charge/static on device surface with plunger causing the stuck issue? I'm not sure, anyone can confirm this?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-If plunger is fully grounded, any charge will be discharged through plunger ground.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">-Chamber Fan ON but this is site1 device stuck MOST, furthest away from Fan and the actual air flow/turbulance in chamber, I'm not sure if it blows the device contact surface with site 1 plunger.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Flow rate of #2 NS8080</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Index Arm 1 Site A-&gt;Site H</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2.4 / 2.4 / 2.4 / 2.3 / 2.4 / 2.4 / 2.6 / 2.4</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Index Arm 2 Site A-&gt;Site H</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2.4 / 2.4 / 2.5 / 2.4 / 2.3 / 2.4 / 2.3 / 2.4</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">So now it seems flow rate of #1 and #2 is in line with EPSON recemmendation of 2.0l/min to 3.0l/min. But just a note this is measurement from index arm hole and not from plunger hole so does not tell us anything about pressure from plunger...</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">NS8080 though has jam on I2070C/P, but it is still better running condition/performance than NS7160W so I think this sunday, #1 and #2 will setup for I2070C/P. They already told us to support/standby when they power up/setup. I've already told UTAC engineer regarding next week support for manpower wise, we're @ minimal and we've already supported I2070C/P setup for about a month so Iwata-san, kindly drop Maxime/Laurence a mail like we discuss yesterday for next week, they should be able to setup/monitor/maintain themselves....</span></p>
