<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Recovery CD Ver 4.0 (FD11S057, 04/28/2011) for NS-8000 4 hands</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;has a bug.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">NS8000 Handler which using the new controller (Black) RC520 S/N: 03-3**** has problem when doing recovery using Recovery CD Ver 4.0 (04/28/2011) FD11S057 for SPI-IB945 CPU Board.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">After recovery, &ldquo;The arm reached the limit of motion range&rdquo; error happened at input/output arms.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Only POSE and SYSTEM data were restored at the point of recovery. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Tried open up the range for both input/output arms but result still the same.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">After recovery, the Hand Pitch at Handler Configuration for X-pitch was at 40mm. these pitch couldn&rsquo;t be changed even HMI was reinstalled.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">The only way to changed was to through the handler.def from the config file and the X-pitch value should be 80mm.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">or copy back the Config folder.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Use Recovery CD Ver 4.1 (FD12S019, 02/13/2012) for 4 hands to solve the problem.</span></p>
