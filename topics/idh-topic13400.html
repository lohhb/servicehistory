<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Subject: EPSON finding on Xilinx Octal Layout kit(device drop &amp; Index arm stuck in socket)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Handler Model: NS-7080W</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Controller: RC520</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Date: 21 Sep 2010</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">EPSON's findings were based on XAP SLK sent to them as follows:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">1) Type of O-ring is reason for vacuum leak. Verification with following contact force @ 125kPa, 250kPa, 450kPa.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Only orange and white type is confirmed by EPSON, no vacuum leak even till 450kPa.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Blue type, has vacuum leak at 250kPa and 450kPa.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Therefore, EPSON's conclusion is blue type O-ring, is not appropriate for handler's application as it causes vacuum leak.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">2) EPSON did not experience the &quot;gap&quot; with the SLK sent to them so they are unable to verify the cause of &quot;gap&quot; and the effect of shims.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">But it means the hook condition of the SLK is still OK condition as they did'nt see the gap. The difference here is the possible causes as follows:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">a) Latch condition is N.G. The spring is for purpose of pulling(holding) the SLK upwards when it locks. If spring loses it's tension, only possible way is to adds shims to increase the mounting height.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">b) If wrong O-ring is used, @ 100+kPa CDA coupled with bad condition of latch, it may cause the &quot;dancing effect&quot;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">c) Very bad condition of guide pins/guide pin hole. From EPSON's point of view, 2 guide pins + 1 orientation guide, once SLK latched on, very unlikely for &quot;dancing effect&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">d) NS7KW-03 was sent back to XAP from SPIL and the handler condition is quite bad as you may know. There may have been pervious crashes or bad condition. The &quot;dancing&quot; effect is really classic and we believe it is a special and could be a one time case due to combination of factors mentioned above.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">e) From Loh's finding of wrong diameter guide pin used, it possibly means the constant &quot;tight fit&quot; and rubbing may have cause deterioration slowly to latch condition as it didn't cause the SLK stuck immediately upon first insertion. In this case, it may indicate the latches had been under stress leading to bad condition. Or in the case of the SLK hook angle change for example.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">10kg spec is the hardware spec of 1 TAKIGEN latch(wrong latch) so based on the weight of SLK sent to EPSON, current design of 2 latches is sufficient to hold it and the &quot;gap&quot; or &quot;dancing&quot; should not happen. If due to guide pin dimensions out should SLK be stuck, definately this will be more than 20kg.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">To summarize, as EPSON did not encounter the &quot;gap&quot; on XAP SLK, they are unable to comment if shims is a must. Their opinion is as long as if it helps in XAP point of view/experience, it can be used. The current design of 2 latches with a combine capability of 20kg with 2 guide pins and orientation pin, it is sufficient. EPSON does not mean the O-ring is the cause of the gap.</span></p>
