<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Handler Model: NS-8080 (S/N: 182094, ) STAgrate</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Controller: RC520 (S/N: 03-02318)&nbsp; HMI: I11.22 MSM</span></p>

<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">One of the sensor wire was broken. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Please refer to attached picture where wire broken. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">It is for output shuttle 1 timing sensor...SQ1-03. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Can you kindly check If you have spare for this? If not, we have to remove from our NS8080. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Temporary solder pins to amplifier directly but unable to be installed together with SQ2-03 because connector was damaged. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Now temporary soldered directly and SQ2-03 no power since unable to be installed with SQ1-03.. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Currently running only arm 1 while waiting for the pin. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Therefore, we need amplifier and cable/connector x 1 set down to shuttle board a.s.a.p. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Kindly let us know if have spare, else may have to remove from handler to send to ST</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts0">Agrate.</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">The items to send to ST Agrate are:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- Fiber Amplifier </span><span class="ts45">E3X-DA6TW-S</span><span class="ts3">&nbsp;x02 pcs (for Output Shuttles timing Sensors)</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">for the Master Connector, the other end of 4 wires split into 2 molex connectors and connect to Shuttle Board: </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- Orange &amp; Blue wire with molex connector go to S1-D3 </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- Black, Brown &amp; Blue with molex connector go to S1-SLT</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- E3X-DA6TW-S x02 pcs </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- Master Cable - complete set </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- Slave Cable - complete set </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- some cable ties </span></p>
<p class="ps126"><span class="ts3">E3X-</span><span class="ts0">MDA6</span><span class="ts3">&nbsp;is equipped with 2 channels but got total 4 ports for inserting the 4 fiber cables. (one beam out light and the other receive light as a pair, so total 2 pairs for 4 holes).</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts3">(E3X-</span><span class="ts0">MDA6</span><span class="ts3">&nbsp;is also use for Input Shuttles Device presence &amp; floating. Channel 1 for Input Shuttle 1 and Channel 2 for Input Shuttle 2).</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts3">In ST Agrate case, as from what you mentioned E3X-</span><span class="ts1">MDA6</span><span class="ts3">&nbsp;also use for Device in Socket sensor.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts3">E3X-DA6TW-S</span><span class="ts55">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts3">is ALSO equipped with 2 channels BUT got total 2 ports for inserting 2 fibers cable(one beam out light and the other receive light).</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts3">This amp can use for Timing sensor and Retro fit kit, so have 2 channels.</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Remarks</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">From picture you can see extend of damage. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">First 2 pair is the same as our office. (left to right of connectors damaged.jpg) </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">the next 2 pair is for socket sensor. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">the first sensor amplifier is the one that was cut and can only direct solder. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">but because the connector damage, unable to connect to slave of the 2nd sensor amplifier. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">so we&rsquo;re running single shuttle/only index arm 1.</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Hope to receive the parts because octal loadboard is coming this week. </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">We have 4 sensors amplifiers total and information as follows: </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- MODEL: E3X-DA6TW-S (first 2 sensor dedicated to buffer position) and E3X-MDA6 (last 2 sensor dedicated to QUAD/OCTAL Socket Sensor) </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- Sensor wire damage is MASTER CONNECTOR (E3X-DA6TW-S) </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- Sensor is 2 channel and 2 wire </span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Sorry for the trouble but I need you guys to remove from office NS8080 the first 2 sensors amplifier with the connection right up to shuttle board including the connectors.</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">So that when I receive, I only need to install back.</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Before you guys remove:</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- confirm both should be E3X-DA6TW-S.</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- take picture and make necessary documentation of 1st amplifier to which connectors of shuttle board</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- take picture and make necessary documentation of 2nd amplifier to which connectors of shuttle board</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">- try to remove before lunch if possible and send to KG to have them rush it out before end of the day</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Btw, what is the difference of EX3-DA6TW-S and EX3-MDA6?</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Cause both has master (ST uses the 2nd one for socket sensor for quad and octal)</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">If I not wrong, EX3-MDA6 has 1 channel but EX3-DA6TW-S has 2 channel?</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Customer actually wants to replace the 3rd sensor amp (from left to right) which is EX3-MDA6 because the wires are exposed.</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">Winston has stock (4 wires but he does not have for slave which is 2 wires) but he does not have the molex and pins and I don&rsquo;t think we have in office?</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">So I&rsquo;m going to tell customer at most we&rsquo;ll replace for the 1st 2 sensor amps.</span></p>
<p class="ps144"><span class="ts0">So, sorry to trouble u guys, I need you guys to remove from our handler.</span></p>
