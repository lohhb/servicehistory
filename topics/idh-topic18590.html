<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Handler Model: NS-8000 series</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Controller: RC520</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Date: 29 Aug 2012</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps4"><span class="ts6">Would like to check with you the following function on Socket Cleaning on NS8080 HMI ver 8G11.51-SAS. </span><img width="549" height="451" border="0" src="images/ns8000-series-socket-cleaningb1.jpg" /></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">1) Can you kindly confirm with Epson what does it mean by [Alarm Count] and [Cleaning Count]? </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">To my understanding, [Alarm Count] means there will be an alarm when the socket cleaning has been carried out the number of time which was specified by user and [Cleaning Count] indicate the number of times socket cleaning have been carried out. </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">According to ASE, when the number of socket cleaning were carried out as what specified at [Alarm Count] no alarm shown, why is that so? </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">Why the [Alarm Count] and [Cleaning Count] unit were in pcs instead of times? </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">Example, </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">[Alarm Count] set at 2 pcs </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">[Cleaning Count] set at 5 pcs </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">After 2 times of socket cleaning carried out, no alarm shown. Instead the alarm shown after the 5th socket cleaning. </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts6">2) No immediate error shown when there&rsquo;s socket cleaning device drop at index arm during socket cleaning process. Is that normal? </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts23">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts5">1)Alarm counts is number of the how many times use the device. </span><span class="ts10">&ndash; Understood</span><br /><span class="ts5">Cleaning counts is how many times machine did the cleaning.</span><span class="ts10">&nbsp;&ndash; Understood</span><br /><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;So It's should be used &quot;Times&quot;. You are right.</span><br /><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;Eg)</span><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;You put the 10pic of the device on tray.then,</span><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;Set number of devices 10pic.</span><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;Set alarm counts is 2.</span><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;alarm occurred will be after 2 cycle of the cleaning.(Total 20pic of the device.10pic x 2) </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts10">- After the 2 cycle of cleaning, no alarm occurred.</span><br /><br /><span class="ts5">&nbsp;2) No immediate meaning is alarm still occurred? What's timing is that? </span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts10">Eg) [Contact Count] set at 5 Times</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts10">- When the cleaning devices drop occurred during the 3rd contact cleaning, there&rsquo;s no alarm. But the alarm only occurred after the 5th contact cleaning.</span><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps6"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts5">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
