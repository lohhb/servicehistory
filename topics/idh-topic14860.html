<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts31">1. Input arm alignment problem after hit to tray arm</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts1">- Was informed by Phumipat, Mr. Chamnan already tried to adjust alignment of input arm unit.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- After handler released for checking, we used 80x60mm shuttle alignment jig to check place position at input shuttle 2. All 4 hands were out of guide holes.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Hand B already offset &ndash;Y from guide hole at the hand adaptor and the moving plate 2 close to rubbing against top plate. </span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Even after loosening all the input arm assy screws, the 4 hands were difficult to align properly to 80x60 pitching. Especially hand B will hit top plate.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Therefore we tried to use our spare input arm assy. . After we replaced the part and fixed back the 4 old hands, we were able to align to 80x60mm pitching. However, alignment to the shuttle jig for all 4 hands were out a bit in the same orientation. As we did not have the auto teaching jig, we fine tune the input arm pick and place from the MMI offset.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Phumipat already talked to Mr. Krengkrai on the replacement items and they will purchase them.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts31">2. Index arm 1 and 2 device drop error</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- As site Ba was disabled when we check the handler, we tried to enable it after we replaced and aligned the input arm assy.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Encountered few counts of device drop error after testing on index arm 2 site Ab.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Check index arm P50 and P51 position with the C/K ok.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Check back handler history and production log book, drop error for arm 1 and 2 started near end Feb. However, SCB did not complain/feedback to Phumipat about it during last few visits.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Check condition of contactor heads and socket guide pins not so good. Some of contactor head guide holes already worn or chipped and socket guide pins surface were not so smooth.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- SCB did not buy and keep any spares for either of these 2 items.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Hotplates were from KA, the rest of the kits were from DB Design. We should recommend SCB to buy and replace worn out C/K parts for this case.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- Before we left, we asked the one of the line engineer to swap the contactor head Aa/Ab with head Ag/Ah to see if device drop error on site Ab migrate. Tomorrow morning we will check result with him again.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts36">3. Mr Krengkrai unable to accept low uph with 1 site disabled</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- As confirmed by Goto san with EPSON Japan, when 1 site disabled, pick up sequence for loader tray will be 1 by 1 instead of 2 by 2.</span></p>
<p class="ps130"><span class="ts0">- We have also explained to Mr. Krengkrai but he still cannot accept it. Even if it means disable 8 site and running only 8 sites to get a higher uph for example.</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- Still encountering device drop issue for index arm. But not on site Ab after contactor head Aa/Ab swapped with head Ag/Ah on 21 Mar night.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- Error history showed random drop error on arm 1 and 2.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- At 7am, according to line engineer, he swapped arm 2 contactor head Bg/Bh with Ac/Ad due to drop error issue on site Bg. He found a small metal debris stuck inside site Bg vacuum port of arm 2 SLK. Advised SCB to take note when doing cleaning of socket and c/k, also check condition of SLK. When we checked handler at 1130am, line engineer reported no more occurrence of drop error for site Bg.</span></p>

<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- As per Goto san request, running setup file and observer data sent. MMI version also confirm as MMI7160W-1.0K.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">- Mr. Krengkrai wants timeline from Goto san, when can reply on this issue after Japan checked setup file. Also he need software to be improved for 2x2 pickup on loader tray even if 1 site disabled.</span></p>
