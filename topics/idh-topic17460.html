<p class="ps126"><span class="ts1">ESP software engineer</span><span class="ts0">&nbsp;would like to share with you our explanation on why we have advised power supply replacement to resolve the &quot;Tester Calibrating&quot; HandlerID issue.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">I have prepared and attached a voltage degradation diagram to better illustrate the scenario.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">Kindly continue to monitor the handler with new PSU and feel free to contact us if you require further explanation.</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><img width="280" height="212" border="0" src="images/0341-ns7kb1.png" /></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts25">Explanation for PSU supply degradation</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">Power supply unit (PSU) is made to last for approx. 6 years. Some internal parts of the PSU are however guaranteed only to operate within 3.5 years.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">Due to degradation of capacitor, supply on the 5V output may be affected.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts25">Explanation for Index Arm moves up and down repeatedly:</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts77">* When voltage supply on 5V supply output degrades to 4.75V, the IFUNT board will be reset.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts77">* When voltage supply on 5V supply output degrades to 4.5V, the handler PC will be reset.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">We suppose that for the &quot;Tester Calibrating&quot; issue to happen, the voltage supply is between 4.75V and 4.5V thresholds, let's assume 4.6V.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">During this case, the IFUNT is reset but PC is still operational. Since IFUNT is reset when tester is testing an IC, PC software will initiate retest causing the index arm to go up and down. Since IFUNT was unintentionally reset, it is no longer synchronized with PC operation.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts25">Explanation for EpsonTypeU and its relation to supply Issue</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">EpsonTypeU is an extended command set created to support &quot;HANDLERID?&quot; query. Expanded set utilizes extra I/O ports.</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">It is possible that for AdvanType1 usage, voltage was slightly above 4.75V. By adding EpsonTypeU set, voltage fell below 4.75 threshold, but above 4.5V limit. </span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts25">Software tool for monitoring</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">Since the issue is related to supply voltage, we cannot issue a software tool to monitor. We can, however, check the IFUNT LED to determine if an IFUNT reset has occurred.</span></p>
