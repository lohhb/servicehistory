<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Handler Model: NS-8080 #1, #2 8 Hand High UPH and NS70-99C</span></p>

<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">1. NS8080-01 I/O pick up hand abnormal threshold reading</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">- Pls see attached file with pictures taken on abnormal threshold reading condition when vacuum not turn on. Maybe we can calibrate/zero the threshold back to 0?</span></p>

<p class="ps13"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">- Also, for the RS485 unknown error which I reported earlier when operation panel power is OFF, I also attached it in the same file under another sheet 'RS485 Unknown error'. This error may be normal and due to no communication between RC520 controller and RS485 board because panel power not turn on? Pls confirm with Japan.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts51">Step 1: Load HMI with operation panel power OFF</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts51">Step 2: Go into Vac Monitor and&nbsp; check all reading as -150Kpa.</span></p>

<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">2. Tray Pick up error</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">- NS8080-02 tray pad was replaced by their own spare yesterday and so far no report on tray pick up error. Roel said after replacing their new tray pad which feels softer , warp trays also can pick up. Today I went in to replace NS8080-01 tray pad with Getech spare. I have raised warranty for these 2 claims.</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">Laurence wants to know why there are 2 different types of tray pad . Their spare one is softer, while the other one from the handler is harder.</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">Pls confirm whether different types of tray pad material are used in sub-con factory.</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">3. Tray Separation Error on Loader and Empty Tray buffer</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">- I have checked and done some adjustment to the loader, reloader 1 and reloader 2 cylinder middle height position. The 4 claws are inserted in even distance between the top and bottom tray. No adjustment has been done on the upper sensor height.</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="ts64">But I noticed sometimes the tray cannot stack properly on top of another tray. Refer to the picture taken below. Not sure if this will cause separation error but it did not occur when i simulated this condition.</span></p>

Just few weeks running and same problem </span><br /><span class="ts58">happen.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- We'll monitor how fast this problem comes back and have an internal </span><br /><span class="ts58">discussion that maybe...revert to rectangle pad may be better than 2-3 weeks </span><br /><span class="ts58">warranty once for vacuum pad? Because 2-3weeks running and claim warranty of </span><br /><span class="ts58">pad is not logic...</span><br /><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;3) Tray Separation Error on Loader and Empty Tray buffer</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- Everytime we at handler to monitor for 2-3 hours, it does not happen.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- Difficult for us to adjust anything if we cannot see problem.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- However, we analyze log file and try to image what possible cause this </span><br /><span class="ts58">error. Maybe too many trays stack or too heavy for cylinder? Maybe some </span><br /><span class="ts58">mis-operation by operator? We've discussed with Hidaka-san to check with </span><br /><span class="ts58">EPSON if our image is possible and how to avoid this problem.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- For now, we'll adjust the cylinder height for loader tray and reloader 1 </span><br /><span class="ts58">based on our image.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;#1 jam data untill 28/01/10</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5137 Loader JAM0904 0 0 0 0 Tray separation cylinder (upper) error </span><br /><span class="ts58">1/27/2010 22:02 retry 10</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5227 Empty 2 JAM1404 0 0 0 0 Tray separation cylinder (upper) error </span><br /><span class="ts58">1/28/2010 6:10 retry 14</span><br /><br /><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3789 Empty 2 JAM1407 0 0 0 0 Tray separation error 1/22/2010 2:46 </span><br /><span class="ts58">retry 15</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5102 Loader JAM0907 0 0 0 0 Tray separation error 1/27/2010 20:06 </span><br /><span class="ts58">retry 96</span><br /><br /><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;4) Inout/Output pickup hand. This is new issue. #1 is this situation but #2 </span><br /><span class="ts58">is still ok...meaning 0kPa..</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- With vacuum not turn ON, reading already -20kPa to -30kpa. With Vaccum </span><br /><span class="ts58">turn on and no deivce, reading some above -35kPa. This is higher than our </span><br /><span class="ts58">set threshold of -35, -40 and -70. This may result in false device pick up.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- Currently, UTAC is not aware of this and we're checking on this.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- If we can zero the vaccum sensor to 0kPa with vaccum not ON, but when </span><br /><span class="ts58">vaccum ON/no device and reading still -35kPa, we may have to clean filter </span><br /><span class="ts58">which requires alignment and we need the jig.</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- If we can zero the vaccum sensor to 0kPa with vaccum not ON, but when </span><br /><span class="ts58">vaccum ON/no device and reading drops to -15kPa for example, situation is </span><br /><span class="ts58">ok....</span><br /><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;5) 99C rental handler</span><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;:- We are waiting for system time to install the SKIP enable switch.</span><br /><br /><span class="ts58">&nbsp;So it seems, no more outstanding except for 4) which is for today and we're </span><br /><span class="ts58">checking. Temporary increase threshold to -40, -45 and -70. But for 4), UTAC </span><br /><span class="ts58">is not aware yet...</span></p>
