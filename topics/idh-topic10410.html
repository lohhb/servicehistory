<p class="ps135"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><span class="ts0">During buyoff,</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><span class="ts0">1) Flying devices in test site</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><span class="ts0">2) Empty tray arm wobble a lot</span></p>

<p class="ps136"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps135"><span class="ts24">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><span class="ts0">1) Flying devices in test site</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">- all individual counter air at index arm 1 and 2 was re-adjusted and device was run again to monitor situation</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><span class="ts0">2) Empty tray arm wobble a lot</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">- screw unable to tighten at all, thus got a a lot of free movement.&nbsp; Replaced a new empty tray arm and problem is dissolved.</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps136"><span class="ts1">3) Device place problem at unloader</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">- found out that all problem is linked to loader, that is, after &quot;END OF TRAY&quot; at loader, when empty tray arm pick tray from loader to empty tray buffer, it is more on &quot;-y'. </span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">It was concluded that the tray stopper at loader was being adjusted previously.&nbsp; Re-adjusted and teaching carried out without misplacement at unloader.</span></p>
<p class="ps133"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">others:</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts36">7~8 Jul 2009</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Hot jam fine tuning carried out at 50 deg as recommended by Wee Boon.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Upon ramming up to 130 deg, a lot of flying devices at index arm 2, thus all manifold at arm 2 were changed.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">After manifold changed, converted to 14x14 to run RVSI.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Note: 5x5 change kit was handed over to Kuo Hong to do ambient jam rate</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Part: Vacuum unit for index (Vacuum Pump) </span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spec: ZX100-Q45MO-PBC-X125 (new spec: ZX100-QU5MO-PBC-X125)</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code: R33ZT96155900</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qty: 05</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts36">9~10 Jul 2009</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">RVSI carried out and fine tuning carried out for all unloaders (14x14 QFP).</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">PM carried out to cur the squeaking noise from index.&nbsp; While doing PM, it was found out that one of the filter screw broke off. Vacuum Pump Filter screw replaced.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts36">14~17 Jul 2009 Flying devices at output shuttle 2 for site 3</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">While doing&nbsp; tuning, there is always flying device on index arm 2 site 3.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">As all manifolds on index arm 2 were new, the first suspect was contactor.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Counter air was on manually and it was found out that the plunger did not protrude out when counter air activated.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Thus, contactor taken out for PM and 'O' ring was replaced as the most probable cause.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Tuning continued without this error anymore.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Drifting observed on loader 'Y' way, but when happened, will affect maybe a row on hot plate or a few pieces (sometimes on +y and sometimes -y).</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps136"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Cause</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Remarks</span></p>
<p class="ps126"><span class="ts1">For flying device after release from Index Arm to Output Shuttle, check points:</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">1) Redo Auto Contact Height (after AutoContact Height increase the device release height by 0.5mm to 3mm)</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">2) Index Nest (worn out? such as chip off?) </span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">3) O-ring worn out on plunger (harden? broken?) </span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">4) Plunger in the contactor(dirty? plunger able to spring out?)</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">5) Spring in Contactor (is it dirty? in good condition?)</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">6) Rubber cup in Contactor (sticky? that stick device? harden? worn out?)</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">7) Index Counter Air On Time (increase or decrease?)</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">8) For 1x2 or inline4, Output Shuttle Device Detection sensor(horizontal) alignment &amp; working condition</span></p>
<p class="ps127"><span class="ts1">9) Index Counter Air (purge air) volume eg. is it too strong or weak</span></p>
