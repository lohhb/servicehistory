<p class="ps127"><span class="ts0">2. Change HDD that you and Loh sent and reboot the handler, can boot-up. Setup new file and running 10% speeds with &quot;Dry. No tray&quot; mode, while running the handler, press the [Cover Open] door switch as your requested, still the same. Handler still operational and MMI still show [Cover Open] icon. forget to perform contact height calibration, causing handler Index over work press error. Turn off from operation panel for 10 sec and turn back on. Trying performing contact height calibration, click on [Contact parameter] dialog, mouser arrow key cannot move and keyboard also inoperational. Reboot handler, cannot start at booting. Attachment Figure 1 is the example.</span></p>

While pressing the [Cover Open] door switch, handler still operational and MMI still show [Cover Open] icon. After homing the handler, setup new file, perform contact height calibration and try run 10% speeds with &quot;Dry. No tray&quot; mode. Handler running about few minutes, error message came up. (About 4 minutes error message came up) After I trying to print-screen the error message by pressing the [Print Screen] key on keyboard. Again the mouser arrow key cannot move and also the keyboard are inoperational. Too late to print-screen the error message.

Still the same, handler still operational while pressing the [Cover Open] and also MMI show the [Cover Open] icon. After homing, try run 10% speeds with &quot;Dry. No tray&quot; mode, few minutes later. Heard the air sound &quot;Tot&quot; like pressing the [PAUSE] or [START] botton. Noted the error message came up and mouser arrow key cannot move and also the keyboard are inoperational again. Also monitor sudden black-out and note circuit breaker CB15 have been tripped.
