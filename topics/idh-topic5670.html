<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Set-up the handler for running TQFP144 20x20 package. Auto Contact height carried out on these new package and subsequently followed by a fine tune for these package. During the dummy run, there were a number of device drop errors at Index Arm 2-A. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Investigation and the checks are as follow:-</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">a) Index Arm 1 &amp; 2 vacuum sensitivity check carried out found good, but vacuum Index Arm 2-A is not as strong as other hands, further investigation found that the nuts for Index Arm 2-A tubing is not tightened, after tightening, problem still persist, other than Arm 2-A, a side finding is that one nut is not even tightened, only a few threads tightened, due to time constraint, only tightened those nuts that are accessible,</span></p>
<p class="ps148"><span class="ts1">b) nest for Index Arm 2-A swapped with Index Arm 2-C, did a device run, problem still persist,</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">c) changed to a new set of layout kit, problem still persist,</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">d) swapped input shutter 1 and 2, problem still persist,</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">e) vacuum wait time increased (0.8 to 1.0), problem still persist,</span></p>
<p class="ps149"><span class="ts1">f) pick up height lowered for index arm 2 (33.5 slowly reduce to 32.9), problem still persist,</span></p>
<p class="ps148"><span class="ts1">g) when problem occurred, take out the affected device and swap another device into pocket A on input shutter 1, &quot;RETRY&quot;, &quot;START&quot;, sometimes will pick up the swapped device, but most of the times problem still exist.</span></p>
<p class="ps149"><span class="ts1">h) pick up height raised for index arm 2 (33.5 to 34), problem solved. After solving index arm 2, the same problem happened on index arm 1 hand D, so pick up height raised for index arm 1 (33.7 to 34.1) and problem also solved, and</span></p>
<p class="ps148"><span class="ts1">i) run 2 trays of dummy, above problem did not appear, thus handler released to them for ICOS verification which will be carried out tomorrow, 26/01/08.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Cause</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Pickup height from input shuttle for Index Arm 1 &amp; 2 is too low.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Remarks</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">There was a case of device drop for both Index Arm 1 &amp; 2, after replacement of Remote I/O Board, problem solved.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Check points for Index Arm Device drop:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">- vacuum cup condition, device drop more frequently in hot mode?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">- o-ring worn out on plunger</span></p>
