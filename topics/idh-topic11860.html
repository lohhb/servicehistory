<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Subject: NS-6040 cannot Auto start SPEL background function</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Handler Model: NS-6040</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Controller: SRC520</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Date: 21~31 May 2010</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">NS6000-3 handler encountered the following problems:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) It cannot restart properly after every shut-down. The MMI main screen doesn&rsquo;t show-up completely after we press &ldquo;Start&rdquo; on the Taskbar. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) We need to go to Spel-95 from the desktop to manually trigger it. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3)Tower lamp indicates red when in running production mode and it doesn&rsquo;t alarm when errors occurred. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">can you kindly tell us more:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) You face this problem all the time ever since this handler has been transferred?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">- </span><span class="ts37">No</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">If NO:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) When did you start seeing this problem? After some illegal shutdown or hang up and restart? etc.</span><span class="ts29">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts3">- </span><span class="ts37">YES</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">If YES:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Kindly explain what you mean by main screen does not show up </span><span class="ts1">completely? Operation panel no response? etc...</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts38">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="ts37">&nbsp;- Only a blank screen will show up and hangs there, even after we press the START button (please see Pic 1)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">4) Other handlers, upon HDD boot up, it automatically loads the MMI and you just need to press START button or every handler requires you to click start manually on the taskbar?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts38">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts37">&nbsp;- YES, other handlers will load the MMI after we press the START button, except for this one (NS6000-3).</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts14">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts39">Unable to load mainscreen</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) You mean nothing shows? Can you send us print screen?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts29">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts37">(Please see Pic 1)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) You mean you double click on SPEL 95 icon? It means MMI was launched but SPEL 95 not launched? </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts37">- The only way we can start this NS6000-3 handler is: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">a.) &nbsp;After reboot, it will go to the blank main screen (pic 1) and stays there. All the taskbars can be seen and activated (Toolpad, Maintepad, etc), pressing the abort at the NS icon will say that the spel95 is running.</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">b.) &nbsp;Then, we need to end the sequence - (pic 3, 3b).</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">c.) &nbsp;Then, abort the Tastbar (pic 4).</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">d.) &nbsp;Then, go to the desktop and activate from the the SPEL95 (pic 5 &amp; 6).</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">e.) &nbsp;Then, go to desktop again and launch NS taskbar so that the main screen (HALT) shows up. Note that the counters will still not show up at this point, even after we ON the main power button (pic 8)</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">f.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we will login as supervisor, enable System Taskbar and Spel95 from the HALT screen (pic 9). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">g.) &nbsp;Then, after the spel95 was launched, we will put it to manual &ldquo;P&rdquo; mode (pic 10) and press run. Only then will the complete screen will show up.</span></p>
<p class="ps138"><span class="ts37">h.) &nbsp;We will NOT put it to auto mode as it will hang the handler. We will then disable the Taskbar &amp; Spel95 and (pic 9). </span></p>
<p class="ps139"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Before that, did you check if&nbsp;you were able to double click on the main screen(HALT) and enter into SPEL? If 2) was carried, I assume you are not able to go into SPEL from here. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts37">- YES, I believe the Spel95 was launch but not completely.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts14">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">I need you to confirm if SPEL 95 was not launched or it was launched but the programs were not launched? Or was it just MMI not launched? </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts37">- Based on the sequence above please advice which has a problem? SPEL95 or MMI?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">For MMI installation, I may be able to guide you over the phone if you have the CD. We do not have your current version as I believe it's customised and very old software. Before you try reinstall, maybe you try to answer my questions first to give me a better understanding of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts39">Tower lamp wrong indication and no alarm</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Did you try to put this tower lamp onto another handler? </span><span class="ts37">YES, I tried other lamps and it displays the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) Try to separate between tower lamp itself or handler? </span><span class="ts37">Done but same result</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">3) Check the patolight settings in MMI or you can use SPEL 95 I/O to trigger lights/alarm. </span><span class="ts37">The only abnormality is when I &ldquo;ON&rdquo; the red light in the IO it will turn OFF and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts14">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Perhaps you want to clear the loading first before looking at the tower lamp problem.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">It seems, SPEL did not launch fully when you click start possibly due to background function was not selected.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">I refer to your Pic10. Can you compare this with another good handler?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Especially:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">1) Main function, you can see a red box around F.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">2) Startup function, you do not have a blue box around F.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Please compare this with your good handler. You should see a blue box around F of startup function like my attached sample.JPG.</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><img width="413" height="274" border="0" src="images/0077-ns6kb1.jpg" /></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">You can click on startup function and click on Background Function tab.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">I know yours is Japanese language, but the SPEL remains the same. Just the FONTS is japanese. So you click on startup function and click background function tab.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Bottomline is you should see a blue box around F of startup function..</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Unless your good handler also same, no blue box around F function?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">After that, you can reboot and see if you still face same problem. If still cannot, you may have to reinstall....but before you reinstall, do a back up first..</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Hidaka-san from ESP maybe able to help you find the correct version of MMI in japanese language.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">For your tower light problem, you may want to trace using the wiring diagram and trobleshoot on the intermediate components like OUTPUT I/O module, cable or SKP board etc..</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">As long as you click from SPEL I/O for the light as well as buzzer and it shows abnormal status as compared to another good handler, it could be some board or I/O module or cable etc..You need to trace the path from PC to Tower light itself based on wiring diagram...Please see attached tower light.JPG. You need the full wiring diagram. My attached is just the main diagram.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">&nbsp;</span><img width="550" height="274" border="0" src="images/0077-ns6kb2.jpg" /></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">btw, this handler is still production capable right? just that you're trying to solve this abnormal loading right?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">31 May 2010</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">It&rsquo;s already fixed and you&rsquo;re correct, the SPEL95 Start-up background function was not activated. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">The tower light also was already in the proper setting. Thank you</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">But I may still need to get the back-up 1.4a version. I&rsquo;ll check first with our Japan side whether they have a back-up to give us.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll inform Hidaka san for a new copy if needed. Thanks again.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Cause</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">SPEL95 Start-up background function was not activated. </span></p>
