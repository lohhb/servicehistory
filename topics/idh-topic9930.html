<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">From the jam data, it seems that some crash happen this morning 6.19am on input side soak boat.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Before this crash, from 23.55pm till 6.19am, it seems something was wrong. Someone was power on/off and temperature change always. Do you know what happen during this time?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">You may need to check with production what exactly happen during this timing of 23.55 to 06.19.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Can you also check on chamber soak area if there are any abnormalities? If possible, please take picture of crash if any.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts3">T-4302, robot 8-11, problem area is all the stepper motor region from PG#2</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;of chamber so please check this area if any parts damaged/crash.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">I think the E-Stop on the DU is ON because HIM unable to load properly. When HMI cannot load, SPEL unable to initialize, E-STOP will be ON. We need more information like jam data or SPEL error history and was it conversion or running production halfway etc.. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">This is the second time it happened.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">1st time</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Main Function and Background Function in SPEL both removed.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">So whenever, MMI load up, it will hang up with no response from control panel.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">2nd time(this time)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Main Function disabled. Only start up function(background) in SPEL running. Purpose of background function is like a background monitoring. As main function was not loaded, it failed to initialise the handler so background monitoring detects abnormalities this time, from Robot 8-11, PG#2.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Note both functions must be selected as main function and background function respectively. Else, SPEL unable to initialise and from DU, E.STOP and ERROR red led will light up. We saw from the HMI jam data, some crash occur on input side soak buffer and before that, about 6 hours of power on/off, temperature setting change and RS232 error. This log is NOT normal. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">From this, we strongly recommend 2 advises:</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">1) Back up regularly. Best is image of harddisk.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">-This time was just functions disabled, if someone delete POSE or delete some function, this is very bad situation.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">2) Consider SPEL password lock.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">-What if someone execute wrong command and crash badly?</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">-Hardware damage, this will be very bad.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">-HMI offers Engineer and Supervisor password lock. You can also SPEL password lock if you are unable to control technician.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Cause</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Main Function was disabled in SPEL CT.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts24">Remarks</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">At a moment, we allow technician to access the SPEL for checking the vacuum level for Index Arm. This will be done during package conversion.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Reason for vacuum level check --&gt; Too many Device Stuck error OR Device Pick-up error on Soak boat especially during running Low Temp.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">This problem already highlighted few time to EPSON for further improvement or countermeasure. But so far, no solution from them about this problem. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Therefore, the only way to minimise this problem is by confirming the vacuum level for each DUT. This action require technician to access SPEL.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">If you have some idea on how technician can confirm this vacuum level without accessing to SPEL, please let me know.</span></p>
