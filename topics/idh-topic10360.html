<p class="ps133"><span class="ts24">Subject: SRC error at Index Arm and Index Arm 2 hit shuttle guide pin</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">Handler Model: </span><span class="ts0">NS-6040 (S/N: 15477)</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">Controller: RC520</span></p>

<p class="ps133"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps133"><span class="ts24">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">During buyoff encountered the following errors:</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">- During contact height calibration, SRC error occurred at index arm found that the homing position out.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">- Index Arm 2 hit the shuttle guide pin when picking up devices. out.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps133"><span class="ts24">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">- During contact height calibration, SRC error occurred at index arm found that the homing position out. </span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts3">Mcorg robot 1 for Index and mcal carried out to solve the issue.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">- Index Arm 2 hit the shuttle guide pin when picking up devices.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts3">Found out the shuttle alignment out.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts36">17 Jun 2009</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">SCR error happened again during contact height cal. mcorg and Teaching on index arm carried out but problem still persist. </span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">Restoring of pose data from previous backup solved the problem.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">QFN 5x5 4sites alignment carried out with missing devices at both shuttles. After adjusting of counter air, counter air time and release height, number of missing devices reduce.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts1">During alignment check found that the all 1x4 (4sites) floating sensors did not turn on and only 1x2 (2sites) floating sensors turn on. But these does gives any error during the alignment check.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts31">24 Jun 2009</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Troubleshooting of the several floating sensors does not turn on found that one of the wire at connector I/O2 partially broken. Wire re-work.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">SRC error and some SPEL errors occurred again during index arm height calibration. Suspecting Z motor faulty. However, replaced Z motor but same error. So motor is ok.</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts31">29~30 Jun 2009 </span><span class="ts36">SRC error occurred during index arm height calibration</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">During installation of original servo pack, CT gain and offset was recorded.&nbsp; Upon boot up, it was found out that all servo pack in DU 1's CT gain and offset were totally different from physical. Thus, physical figure keyed in and height calibration was carried out without problem.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps133"><span class="ts24">Cause</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">SRC error occurred during index arm height calibration</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts3">-could be due to Index Arm homing position out.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts3">-could be due to Servo pack (servo driver) CT Gain and CT Offset for DU1 having wrong value.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Index Arm 2 hit the shuttle guide pin when picking up devices.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts3">Found out the shuttle alignment out.</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps134"><span class="ts0">Floating sensors not turn on </span><span class="ts3">due to wire connector IO 2 partially broken.</span></p>
