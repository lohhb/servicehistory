<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Subject: Jamming at unloaders and problem with empty tray arm</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Handler Model: NS-7080W (S/N: 121282, StatsChippac)</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Controller: RC520</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">Date: 25 Apr 2008</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Symptom</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Regarding jamming, the complaint was that the unloaders were too fast initially which causes the devices to float or go missing. </span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps2"><span class="ts23">Action</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">SCS PM guys did some adjustment on the previous night, but he adjusted the speed of the unloader to be too slow which induce another problem.&nbsp; This other problem was that the tray had not even reach the ending point and the lifter had already kicked in which caused the whole tray to be tilted with devices dropping around the unloader area.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Upon accessing this problem, found out that the package SCS is currently running on this handler is a very thin and light, 8x8 package. Which means the speed for the unloader/loader must be just nice in order not to cause any floating of devices.&nbsp; Thus we did a tuning for all loader and unloaders speed.&nbsp; After monitoring for half to one hour, everything was fine.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><br /><span class="ts4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts0">As for the empty tray arm issue, noticed that whenever the empty tray arm placed any tray on unloader, there was a lot of vibration on the arm, this is due to the body is too wide and the metal plate supporting the arm is very thin which introduce a lot of unwanted vibration to the empty </span><span class="ts1">tray arm.&nbsp; This vibration will cause the tray on the empty tray to drop out of the predesignated place. In order to solve this problem, empty tray arm hand down time was increased and situation was monitored for a few trays and everything was smooth.</span></p>
<p class="ps3"><span class="ts1">Final solution is that a cushion was </span><span class="ts0">inserted&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;behind the empty tray arm to reduce the impact on the vibration.&nbsp; (monitoring in progress)</span></p>
